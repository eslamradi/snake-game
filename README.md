#Snake Game
This C++ Source Code was written by me in 2016.
It resembles my first Object-Oriented Programming Project.
The fun part is that it's actually the basic snake game but it was developed using c++ without using a fancy gui, just the basic console black screen.
YEAH, you read that right. 
The game keeps track of the High score per session so you can as well challenge your friends.
It has all the functionality of the basic snake game, so there are trophies to eat with timing so they don't last forever just for a limited time but the snake can reach them ofc.
There are also special trophies appears suddenly and randomly with bigger value than normal ones.
The snake grows each time it eats a trophy, and it can also walk through borders to reach the opposite border.
and ofc the Game is Over when the snake eats itself.
#Phases for the project.
1. A simple one file source code with a main scope handling everything.
2. Main scope is improved, through organizing the code into separate functions.
3. The code is developed into class and is object oriented.
4. Code Optimization and functionalities enhancement.
5. The Code in this format as the final touch with great functionalities and optimized resources.

I'll be uploading a video sample on the final output of this project soon.
stay tuned!
